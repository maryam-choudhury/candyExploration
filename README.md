## **Guiding Question**

How do factors such as sugar content, cost, and ingredients influence a candy's popularity, and what insights can be drawn from these metrics when categorizing candies by budget tiers?

## **Introduction**

Cumulatively, we consume a lot of candy each year. 8 pounds, 20 pounds...estimates for the amount of candy Americans alone eat a year are thrown around like hotcakes. Whatever the actual number is, it's undoubtedly large, and it is only natural that compelling datasets exist. \n

This report will use a dataset containing the results of a tournament-style poll hosted by FiveThirtyEight. The results included 8,371 unique IP addresses, so while it is not the result of a controlled scientific study, it has a wide enough breadth to assume it is a good enough sample of candy preferences for our casual purposes. In addition to tournament standing, each observance of unique candy includes ingredient presence, pleurisy, and price information. Please visit the GitHub repo linked in the source section below to learn more about individual variables and look at the original data set. \n

This report is a trial of using R to create compelling graphics that will allow us to uncover insightful analysis. Specifically, it is setting out to better understand what factors, such as price and sugar content, influence a candy's popularity. Besides being fun, these insights can help someone decide on what candies to buy to appease a crowd. If we break these insights on candy popularity down even further, we can even help people decide in line with an ideal budget.
